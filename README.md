# NecrobotVisualizer

You have to be up to date on the Necrobot side (master or maybe latest release).  
In the Visualizer, the url on the config page should match the port you configured on NecroBot side (both have the same default).

## Installer

Go to the release tab, grab the latest and just launch it.

## Run from Code

npm i && npm start
